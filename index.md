## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="./imgs/photo.jpg">

- I was born in Nanchang, China in 1994. I am currently working in Alibaba DAMO Academy. I received my B.S. and Ph.D. degree from Zhejiang University, under the supervision of Prof. [Wei Jiang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/jiangwei), in 2015 and 2020, respectively. 

- If you are applying for a Research Intern or a PhD student in computer vision, you also can contact me. I co-supervise PhD students with Prof. Wei Jiang at Zhejiang University.

- You can find my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=7QvWnzMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and my open source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/michuanhaohao).
